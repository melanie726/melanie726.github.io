    <p>Tourists usually come to New York City for its main attractions, art, fashion, music, and theaters. I live in Queens and pretty much the only popular place here is Flushing. But a place I think of when I am at home is this place called Metro Mall. The building itself is large in size and is pretty far away from the rest of the neighborhood. In fact, the mall is located right across from a cemetery. This is quite a weird location, but the mall is far from being scary or haunted. The front of the mall is yellow with a large sign that says “Funtopia USA” and then “Metro Mall” right below. The back part of the mall is where all the clothing is located and the front are stores like BJs, Funtopia, furniture stores, etc. Funtopia is an arcade place located on the second floor. The parking lot in front of the mall is a large space and is quite peaceful to look at. By just looking at the exterior, it is clear that this mall is old and run down. After all, it was actually built back in 1965, but that is what makes this place stand-out. I’ve lived in New York my whole life and it’s sad to see places come and go. To have a mall as authentic as this one is a miracle by itself.</p>
    <p>With all the different groups of people coming in and out of the mall on a daily basis, the mall feels alive and was a home to us all. As soon as people enter the mall, they would see a Burger King restaurant and a Payless shoe store to the right, then a liquor store, pet store, and furniture store to the left. At the far end, there is BJs, a large warehouse selling everything from food to electronics. Being that the mall is located in front of a cemetery and nowhere near any houses, the only way to get to the mall is by bus or car. Therefore, I would usually see large families coming together by car to go grocery shopping. It is a fact that every time my family and I went to this mall to go grocery shopping, we ate at Burger King. That restaurant was a magical place for all little kids. Some of the seats were shaped like cars and every table was filled with parents and their kids wearing Burger King crowns on their heads. There is also a furniture store, Raymond and Flanigan, attached to the far right of the building, which explains why many cargo workers come in trucks to transport new furniture.</p>
    <p>Metro Mall was my hangout space, a place I was familiar with, and is a place I will forever cherish in my memories. Everytime I walked through that grand entrance, cold air rushed through my hair from the air conditioning and happiness rushed through my body as I took in the smell of Burger King french fries and chicken nuggets. I think I’ve been to over five parties at Funtopia when I was younger. Looking back, Funtopia was rigged because the prizes for playing the arcade games were all cheap and of poor quality. Yet, as a kid, I didn’t care because I just wanted to have fun. I remember crying because all my friends wanted to play laser tag but I was scared because I thought that laser tag had actual lasers. Nowadays, Metro Mall has become a complete ghost town. The last time I went to the mall, which was about five months ago, the lights at the top of the ceiling were no longer on so it was very dark. The mall felt like an abandoned cave, with expanses of empty hallways that once used to be filled with kids running to Funtopia. Both the liquor store and pet store closed down and were never replaced with any other store. I don’t know the owners of this mall, but clearly they are carelessly running the place, probably waiting for the mall to close down entirely. The mall is no longer crowded and only about 40 cars are parked in the parking lot when usually there’s supposed to be over 100 cars. Kids would rather hang out in more modern and popular areas.</p>
    <p>To the left of the Metro Mall is the Metropolitan Avenue subway station, the station I go to get to school every morning. Seeing the mall brings back so many old memories. It is weird to pass by the shopping center everyday for school and yet at the same time, it feels so far and vacant. Just like how the mall is old, it is also a symbol of the old life I put behind and abandoned.
